# Finagle Playground

### Purpose:
The main purpose of this repository is to provide a platform for developers to explore and experiment with Finagle, a protocol-agnostic RPC system for the JVM, created by Twitter. Specifically, we focus on building, testing, and refining HTTP servers and clients using Finagle's powerful features and functionality.

### Features:
- Boilerplate code for setting up Finagle HTTP servers and clients.
- Examples demonstrating various aspects of Finagle HTTP, such as routing, request handling, and response processing.
- Test suites for validating the behavior and performance of Finagle HTTP components.
- Integration with popular tools and libraries for testing and benchmarking.

### Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies, including Java and Scala.
3. Explore the provided examples, test suites, and utilities.
4. Experiment with custom configurations, routes, and middleware to suit your requirements.
5. Run tests and benchmarks to evaluate the performance and reliability of your Finagle HTTP implementations.
